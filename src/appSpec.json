        "designSummary": "**The Zen Grid: Precision, Space, and Purpose**\n\nThe design philosophy for this portfolio is rooted in the principles of extreme minimalism and functional clarity, drawing inspiration from both the rigorous order of the Swiss Grid and the serene intentionality of Japanese Zen gardens. The goal is to create a digital space that is not merely a container for content, but an extension of the professional's meticulous and analytical mind. Every element is stripped down to its essential function, allowing the user's work and expertise to be the sole focus. This approach ensures a high-end, professional, and deeply trustworthy presentation.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **The Grid as Foundation, Not Constraint:** A strict 12-column grid will be the underlying structure, ensuring perfect alignment and balance. However, the emphasis will be on using this grid to *frame* content and *create* vast expanses of negative space, rather than filling it densely.\n2. **Typography as the Sole Ornament:** Hierarchy will be achieved exclusively through size, weight, and case variations of a single, highly legible sans-serif font. No decorative typography or font mixing will be employed.\n3. **Monochromatic Harmony with a Single Accent:** The palette will be strictly black, white, and shades of grey. A single, functional accent color will be used with extreme restraint, reserved only for critical interactive elements like links or calls to action to guide the user's eye without distraction.\n4. **Whitespace as a Design Element:** Generous margins and padding are not afterthoughts but primary design components, creating breathing room and enhancing readability. The visual rhythm will be dictated by multiples of a base spacing unit.\n5. **Functional Components Only:** UI elements will be devoid of ornamentation. Buttons, cards, and forms will be defined by their clean lines, precise spacing, and clear typography, with subtle hover states providing feedback.",

The 'secondary' color is effectively identical to the 'background' in this monochromatic theme but can be used for cards or distinct content blocks if a slight variation is introduced later. Use the 'gridLine' color to draw the explicit borders that define the layout's structure. The 'subtleText' color should be reserved for meta-data or less critical information, ensuring it remains legible against the 'background'. Avoid introducing any other colors; the power of this brand lies in its restraint.",

The combination of 'primary' (black) and 'primaryForeground' (white) yields a contrast ratio of approximately 19:1, far exceeding WCAG AAA standards. Similarly, the 'background' and 'foreground' pairing offers the same high-level contrast. The 'secondary' and 'secondaryForeground' pair also meets AAA standards. Ensure that the 'gridLine' color maintains enough contrast to be visible but not distracting. The 'subtleText' against 'background' should be checked to ensure it stays above 4.5:1 for AA compliance."

The goal is to create a digital space that is not merely a container for content, but an extension of the professional's meticulous and analytical mind. Every element is stripped down to its essential function, allowing the user's work and expertise to be the sole focus. This approach ensures a high-end, professional, and deeply trustworthy presentation.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. **The Grid as Foundation, Not Constraint:** A strict 12-column grid will be the underlying structure, ensuring perfect alignment and balance. However, the emphasis will be on using this grid to *frame* content and *create* vast expanses of negative space, rather than filling it densely.\n2. **Typography as the Sole Ornament:** Hierarchy will be achieved exclusively through size, weight, and case variations of a single, highly legible sans-serif font. No decorative typography or font mixing will be employed.\n3. **Monochromatic Harmony with a Single Accent:** The palette will be strictly black, white, and shades of grey. A single, functional accent color will be used with extreme restraint, reserved only for critical interactive elements like links or calls to action to guide the user's eye without distraction.\n4. **Whitespace as a Design Element:** Generous margins and padding are not afterthoughts but primary design components, creating breathing room and enhancing readability. The visual rhythm will be dictated by multiples of a base spacing unit.\n5. **Functional Components Only:** UI elements will be devoid of ornamentation. Buttons, cards, and forms will be defined by their clean lines, precise spacing, and clear typography, with subtle hover states providing feedback.",

Secondary shades of grey (#808080, #F5F5F5, #333333) are used for subtle distinctions, borders, or secondary text. A single accent color, #007AFF, is reserved for interactive elements like links, buttons, and active states, used with extreme restraint to guide user attention without overwhelming the minimalist aesthetic.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "High contrast ratios are maintained between foreground and background colors (e.g., #000000 on #FFFFFF, #FFFFFF on #007AFF) to ensure WCAG AA compliance for text and interactive elements. Grays are chosen to provide sufficient contrast for secondary information without compromising legibility."

  "initialPrompt": "Create a clean, modern, minimalist personal portfolio website for a technical professional (Data Science / Engineering / AI focused). The website should be high-end, simple, and content-first, inspired by modern personal portfolios like lyleseebeck.me. Style: minimalist, modern, professional, technical; white or very light background, strong contrast text, clean sans-serif typography (Inter, Helvetica Neue, or similar), large margins, generous whitespace, subtle animations (fade-ins, hover effects), desktop-first but fully responsive, no stock photos. Homepage: single-scroll landing page with hero section (name, one-line descriptor, short bio), minimal navigation bar (Home, Projects, About, Resume, Contact). Projects section: case-study driven, vertical list or 2-column grid, each project card with title, short description, tags, 'View Project' link; dedicated project pages with overview, problem, approach, tools, results, optional visuals. About section: text-focused, short bio, technical background, interests, problem-solving approach, optional small portrait. Resume section: clean timeline/list, roles with company, title, dates, 1–2 impact bullet points, Download Resume button. Contact section: minimal, short invite, contact form (name, email, message), GitHub, LinkedIn, Email links. Footer: minimal, name + year, small social links. Prioritize clarity, structure, professionalism; avoid heavy gradients, loud colors, excessive graphics. The site should feel like a personal engineering notebook meets a professional portfolio, calm, intentional, confident, and original.",
